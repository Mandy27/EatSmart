####Implemented Features:

- Create Habit and add in Firebase database. ( by Harrison Wang)
- Edit Habit and save in database ( by Mandy Ngo )
- Delete Habit, confirmation pop-up, save in database ( by Mandy Ngo )
- UI focused JavaScript ( by Christy Lao )
- Implemented Online Notification without using any library ( by Mandy Ngo , Tyler Nguyen)

####Notes:
- We haven't implemented multiple users yet.
- We did not implement offline notifications. We do not think that offline notifications are necessary because they are rarely (if ever) implemented on websites. If we were creating a native app for Android or iOS, this would certainly be necessary. However, even the most popular online services (Faceboook, Twitter, Slack) do not send offline notifications through their web applications. Push notifications are provided through native applications instead.
- We have not deployed the app. Therefore, in order for the notification to work properly, please in Terminal go into the project directory and run " python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 ". In addition, if the app is in fullscreen mode, users won't be able to see the notification .
- We haven't been able to store icons in the database yet.
