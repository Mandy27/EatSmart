- We did not implement offline notifications. We do not think that offline notifications are necessary because they are rarely (if ever) implemented on websites. If we were creating a native app for Android or iOS, this would certainly be necessary. However, even the most popular online services (Faceboook, Twitter, Slack) do not send offline notifications through their web applications. Push notifications are provided through native applications instead.
