# EatSmart
####Implemented Features:
- Create Habit. (By Harrison)
- Implemented Online Notification (By Mandy Ngo , Tyler Nguyen).

####Notes:
- We did not implement offline notifications. We do not think that offline notifications are necessary because they are rarely (if ever) implemented on websites. If we were creating a native app for Android or iOS, this would certainly be necessary. However, even the most popular online services (Faceboook, Twitter, Slack) do not send offline notifications through their web applications. Push notifications are provided through native applications instead.
- We have not deployed the app. Therefore, in order for the notification to work properly, please in Terminal go into the project directory and run " python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 ". In addition, if the app is in fullscreen mode, the notification won't be displayed.
